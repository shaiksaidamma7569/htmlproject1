    <h3>Movie Review</h3>
    <p>Om Namo Venkatesya is another rare film for devotees and award winning performance of Nagarjuna and terrific direction by Raghavendra Rao does not disappoint.

Om Namo Venkatesaya (2017): India is a diverse country with number of Gods which in turn created number of religions and groups.Mythology and devotional stories of India are famous all over the world.There are very few directors who can bring those larger than life stories onto screen. K.Raghavendra rao is one of the rare ones who is expert in making devotional movies without missing any commercial elements.His Annamayya and Sri Ramadasu are considered classics and fans of both Nagarjuna and Raghavendra Rao always expect a devotional movie from them.But their last combo Shiridi Sai failed to impress critics and fans alike.Now they are back with bio-pic of Hathiram Baba,a devotee of Lord Venkateshwara, who is said to have created rules and regulations on Tirumala Hills.
